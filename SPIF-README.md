## Background and Motivation

The SPIF data standard was conceived as an open and accessible means of storing individual cloud particle images generated by optical array probes (OAPs) \[[Knollenberg, 1970](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1970)009<0086:TOAAAT>2.0.CO;2)\]. OAPs use a one-dimensional photodiode array to record successive slices of an image of the shadow that is cast by a particle as it moves across the instrument's sample volume. The use of such instruments has lead to decades worth of in situ cloud particle-by-particle data taken across the gamut of pristine and anthropogenically-modified \[[Quaas, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40641-015-0028-0)\] cloud types. More recently, probes using two dimensional imagers, such as the [SPEC](http://www.specinc.com) CPI (Cloud Particle Imager) \[[Lawson et al., 2001](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2000JD900789)\] and HOLODEC (Holographic Detector for Clouds) \[[Fugal & Shaw, 2009](https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/2/259/2009/)\] have produced very high resolution images with greater colour depth of cloud particles.

Image data from such probes is produced in proprietry and instrument- or system-specific formats. Binary formats have evoluved around the limitations of legacy hardware and bandwidth limitations. This means that there may be a significant barrier to new users of image data, particularly for users that are not from fields that have traditionally used such cloud data. Fields such as remote sensing and atmospheric process modelling may well benefit by being able to ingest cloud particle data into their processing streams.

The SPIF standard has been designed so that decoded raw binary data can stored in a [NetCDF4](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) file structure with a standardised vocabulary in accordance with [FAIR Guiding Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) \[[Wilkinson et al., 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)\]. It is hoped that this will improve access to this data for users from a wide range of fields and facilitate the sharing, refinement, and standardisation of data processing routines \[for a discussion on inconsistencies between current particle processing routines see [McFarquhar et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1175/AMSMONOGRAPHS-D-16-0007.1)\].


## SPIF Files

[NetCDF4](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) files are widely used in the atmospheric science community as they can be made fully self-describing with metadata relating to the entire file, subsets of the file contents, and individual data variables may be carried within the file. and so is supported on a variety of platforms, environments, and programming languages and commonly used in environmental science communities
