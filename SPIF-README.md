# SPIF - Single Particle Image Format data standard

information see [paper_placeholder](https://github.com/graemenott/spif-paper).

## Background and Motivation

The SPIF data standard was conceived as an open and accessible means of storing optical array probe (OAP) \[[Knollenberg, 1970](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1970)009<0086:TOAAAT>2.0.CO;2)\] individual cloud particle images. OAPs use a one dimensional detector array to record successive slices of an image of the shadow that is cast by a particle as it moves across the instrument's sample volume. The use of such instruments has lead to decades worth of cloud particle-by-particle data taken in the gamut of pristine and anthropogenically-modified \[[Quaas, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40641-015-0028-0)\] cloud types. More recently probes using two dimensional imagers, such as the [SPEC](http://www.specinc.com) CPI (Cloud Particle Imager) \[[Lawson, 2001](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2000JD900789)\] and HOLODEC (Holographic Detector for Clouds) \[[Fugal, 2009](https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/2/259/2009/)\] have produced very high resolution images with greater colour depth.
