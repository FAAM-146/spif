Background and Motivation
=========================

The SPIF data standard was conceived as an open and accessible means of storing individual cloud particle images. Real-time images of liquid and ice particles from aircraft are routinely generated by optical array probes (OAPs) [#Knollenberg1970]_. OAPs use a one-dimensional photodiode array to record successive slices of an image of the shadow that is cast by a particle as it moves across the instrument's sample volume. The use of such instruments has led to decades worth of in situ cloud particle-by-particle data taken across the gamut of pristine and anthropogenically-modified [#Quaas2015]_ cloud types. More recently, probes using two dimensional imagers, such as the `SPEC <http://www.specinc.com>`_ CPI (Cloud Particle Imager) [#Lawson2001]_ and HOLODEC (Holographic Detector for Clouds) [#Fugal2009]_ have been used to produce very high resolution images with greater colour depth of cloud particles.

Image data from such probes is recorded in proprietary and instrument- or system-specific formats. Binary formats have evolved due to the limitations of legacy hardware and limited system bandwidths. This means that is a significant barrier to new users of image data, particularly for users that are not from fields that have traditionally used such cloud data. Fields such as remote sensing and atmospheric process modelling may well benefit by being able to ingest raw cloud particle data into their processing streams as these applications may require specialised or different processing options to those normally used by those in the cloud measurement community.

The SPIF standard has been designed so that decoded raw binary data are stored in a `netCDF4 <https://doi.org/10.5065/D6H70CW6>`_ file structure with a standardised vocabulary in accordance with `FAIR Guiding Principles <https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/>`_ [#Wilkinson2016]_. It is hoped that this will improve access to this data for users from a wide range of fields and facilitate the sharing, refinement, and standardisation of data processing routines (for a discussion on inconsistencies between current particle processing routines see McFarquhar et al., 2017 [#McFarquhar2017]_
).

-----------------
The SPIF standard
-----------------

The SPIF standard is a standardised vocabulary for storing image data and metadata in `netCDF4 <https://doi.org/10.5065/D6H70CW6>`_ files. NetCDF allows for fully self-describing, archival standard data and is supported on a variety of platforms, environments, and programming languages and commonly used in earth science communities. Conventions and best practice guides such as `Attribute Convention for Dataset Discover <https://wiki.esipfed.org/Attribute_Convention_for_Data_Discovery_1-3>`_ (ACDD) and `CF (Climate and Forecast) Conventions <https://cfconventions.org>`_ are used to standardise the netCDF4 metadata and variable structures to suit a particular field and so facilitate access, standard workflows, and comparison between datasets.

In a similar fashion to the CF Conventions; SPIF defines a minimum vocabulary, that is groups, variables, and attributes, that must be included for compliance. SPIF is referred to here as a format standard, rather than a convention, as it stipulates the form of the variable data as well as variable attributes. This is to ensure that all raw data required for processing is included in a consistent structure. SPIF has been designed to be compatible with common data conventions so is possible to create a SPIF file that is also compliant with ACDD, CF, other conventions, and any organisational requirements.

Additional data can be stored in a SPIF file along with the required vocabulary to provide ancillary data from other sources, processed data products, or instrument housekeeping data to aid in diagnostic investigations. Any such data contained within the file is optional but should not conflict with requirements of the SPIF standard.

-------------------
Standard Compliance
-------------------

This `repository <https://github.com/FAAM-146/spif>`_ contains the *vocal* project for the SPIF data standard. *Vocal* is a tool for managing netCDF data product standards and associated data product specifications. It can be used to check netCDF file compliance to a standard, including SPIF. See the :doc:`SPIF project page <spif-project>` for more details.

The SPIF convention string can be added to the ``Conventions`` global attribute of a netCDF file that is compliant, that is;

.. code-block:: ncl

  Conventions: "SPIF-m.n"

where ``m`` is the major version, and ``n`` the minor version of the SPIF standard.


-------------------
SPIF File Structure
-------------------

SPIF files use netCDF4 groups to divide multiple instruments and to separate image data from other types of data. The group structure of a SPIF file will look like;

.. parsed-literal::
  :name: spif-structure-basic

  **root**
    │
    ├── *platform*
    │
    ├── **<instrument-1>**
    │   │
    │   ├── **core**
    │   │
    │   ├── *auxillary*
    │   │
    │   ├── *level-0*
    │   │
    │   ├── *level-1*
    │   │
    │   └── *level-2*
    │
    ├── <*instrument-2*>
    │   │
    │   └── ...
    │
    └── ...

Groups in bold are mandatory while those in italics are optional. The instrument groups are labelled as ``<instrument-1>``, ``<instrument-2>``,...``<instrument-n>`` where the angled braces ``< >`` indicate that the name used in the SPIF file will be some other string. The file structure and required vocabulary are described below.

The SPIF definition is somewhat constrained to ensure that standard-compliant files contain all the information/data required for future processing. SPIF files must contain, as a minimum, a set of mandatory parameters. That is groups, attributes, and (coordinate) variables.

    :doc:`List of Mandatory Parameters <spif_mandatory_vocab>`

In addition to these mandatory netCDF parameters, a SPIF file can be extended with additional groups, attributes, and (coordinate) variables. It may assist users if these added parameters are familiar and so some suggested optional parameters are given;

    :doc:`List of Optional Parameters <spif_optional_vocab>`

Further information on optional groups and their contents are described in :doc:`spif_extensions`.



In order to be SPIF-compliant, a file must have a prescribed structure and a set of included parameters. The exact list of mandatory parameters---parameters include netCDF groups, attributes, dimensions and variables---are given :doc:`here <spif_mandatory_params>` [#ParamGenerationFoot]_.




Some of these groups and their contents are required and are shown below;

```
root
  ├ :Conventions = "SPIF-1.0"
  ├── <instrument-1>
  │   ├ :instrument_name
  │   ├ :instrument_long_name
  │   ├ `float32` color_level(pixel_colors)
  │   ├ `int32` array_size(array_dimensions)
  │   ├ `int32` image_size(array_dimensions)
  │   ├ `float32` resolution(array_dimensions)
  │   ├ `float32` wavelength()
  │   ├ `float32` pathlength()
  │   └── core
  │       ├ `uint8` image(pixel)
  │       ├ `uint64` timestamp(image_num)
  │       │   └ :standard_name = "time"
  │       ├ `uint32` startpixel(image_num)
  │       ├ `uint8` width(image_num)
  │       ├ `uint8` height(image_num)
  │       └ `byte` overload(image_num)
  │
  ├── <instrument-2>
  │   └── ...
  │
  └── ...
```

### File root

There is only one required global attribute which is ``Conventions``. This must include the text "SPIF-m.n", where "m.n" are the major and minor versions. Other conventions strings can also be included with as a space- (recommended) or comma-separated list.

#### Mandatory Attributes:

> _Conventions:_ A space or comma delineated list of conventions given in a single string. Must include "SPIF-m.n" where m.n is the version number.

There are many recommended global attributes, users may refer to the [ACDD](https://wiki.esipfed.org/Attribute_Convention_for_Data_Discovery_1-3) which lists many.


### Instrument group

It is envisaged that SPIF files will normally contain data from a single instrument. However it may make sense to include more than one instrument or an instrument with more than one channel, for example the [SPEC](http://www.specinc.com) [2D-S (Stereo) Probe](http://www.specinc.com/2d-s-stereo-probe-operation) which has two orthogonal OAPs, in the same file. The names of the instrument groups are not prescribed but should be descriptive. Group attributes ``instrument_name`` and ``instrument_long_name`` contain more complete instrument information. In this text the instrument groups are written as ``<instrument-1>``, ``<instrument-2>``, etc where the braces indicate that it is not a literal string.

The instrument group contains variables with information about the probe size, resolution, and other data required for interpreting the raw images.

#### Mandatory Attributes:

> _instrument_name:_ Short name of the instrument. If may be the same as the group name.

> _instrument_long_name:_ Full descriptive name of instrument.

#### Recommended Attributes:

> _instrument_description:_ Further description of the instrument

> _instrument_manufacturer:_ Instrument manufacturer

> _instrument_model:_ Manufacturer's model designation

> _instrument_serial_number:_ Instrument serial number

> _instrument_software:_ Name of data acquisition software interfacing with instrument

> _instrument_software_version:_ Version of data acquisition software interfacing with instrument

> _instrument_firmware:_ Firmware version of instrument

> _raw_filenames:_ List of filename of raw binary image data from which this data was obtained

#### Mandatory Variables:

> `float32` **color_level**(pixel_colors): Lower bound of fractional obscuration/grayscale/color level of photodiode array for each color_value. Gives the number of shadow/gray/color levels in the image.

> `int32` **array_size**(array_dimensions): Number of pixels on the detector.


> `int32` **image_size**(array_dimensions): Number of pixels across an image. If fixed size then will be number of pixels, if variable size then use `_FillValue`.

> `float32` **resolution**(array_dimensions): Image resolution of instrument for each dimension.

> `float32` **wavelength**(): Operating wavelength of laser used for shadowing/imaging the particles.

> `float32` **pathlength**(): Optical path length of imaging region.

#### Recommended Variables:

> `float32` **color_value**(pixel_colors): Value of each color used in image. Usually these will be contiguous but the does not have to be. Can be included to facilitate arbitrary values to be used in the "image" variable.

> `float32` **resolution_error**(array_dimensions): Uncertainty of the image resolution of instrument for each dimension.



### Instrument Core group

The instrument Core group is where the flattened image data is stored. There are two unlimited dimensions in the core group, "image_num" and "pixel". The maximum value of the coordinate variable "image_num" is the number of images in the dataset while the maximum of "pixel" is the total number of pixels in the image array.

The arrival time of each image is given by "timestamp" in a recognised time, usually nanoseconds, from a reference time. Time variables have a units string attribute that conforms to the [UDUNITS recommendation](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.11/cf-conventions.html#time-coordinate), for example “nanoseconds since 2024-01-01 00:00:00 +0”. The "timestamp" variable has
a ``standard_name`` attribute "time". It's worth mentioning that due to the random nature of cloud sampling, the data in "timestamp" will be highly irregular and different from what one may expect from timeseries data.
